<h3>The alternative celtic rock band from North Queensland
</h3>
<p>Typical audience response: - "WOW - I wasn't prepared for that! Racing around the stage in kilts, blowing bagpipes, jumping from one instrument to the next, these guys know how to entertain!". </p>

<li>They will break your heart with the mournful and eerie sounds of the Great Highland Bagpipe and then crank it up real hard and rock you 'til you drop.</li>

<li>This 11 piece band is a fun-loving kick-em-in-the-pants band that just wants to rock - celtic style!
