	<p style="color: #060000"; style="font-size: 60px;">A professionally-managed venue will have a standard configuration, which will typically have a floor plan and information about seating, stage, sound, lighting, bar and catering, etc. If you stick to the standard configuration you will minimise costs.
If you want to change the configuration you will be responsible for any costs incurred in the change, and you will also be responsible for returning the venue to its standard configuration. Some venues will allow you to do some of this work; most will charge you for some or all of it. You may also be charged an extra fee for any equipment that is not included in the standard hire charge.
Pianos require special consideration, because they are vulnerable to damage when moved or lifted. Moving a piano a short distance over a smooth flat floor usually causes no problem, but lifting it onto a raised stage requires manpower and/or lifting equipment. Grand pianos are particularly vulnerable. Most venues do not permit their grand piano to be lifted and require it to be tuned after any significant movement. Once a piano has been moved into position and tuned, it should not be moved again before the performance.
The standard hire charge may apply for the whole day, but the venue management may require payment for at least one person to be on duty for all the hours that you are actually present.
The compere, stage manager, sound and lighting operators and even the ushers all contribute to the success of your show. Please don’t spring any surprises on them. If you want to do something unorthodox or “unexpected” then it all needs to be carefully planned and, if possible, rehearsed.</p>
