<h1>Susan Grinsell</h1>
<p>The concept of the Camerata Singers originated in the 1980s when Susan Grinsell, who was teaching voice at James Cook University realised that ensemble singing was sadly lacking for tertiary music students. Since then, Susan, along with repetiteur Carol Dallâ€™Osto, has strived to bring quality ensemble singing to the wider community by performing at events from the Ingham Italian Festival through to Cotterâ€™s Markets in the mall. 

The Camerata Singers comprises a group of trained singers, both male and female, from age 18 and over who strive to provide quality performances in a range of styles from classical through to A cappella and contemporary. A number of members also regularly participate in local music theatre and theatre productions.</p>
