<p>Commercial advertising is expensive and for a small budget, not very effective.
All the news media like to publicise community events, but they need to be fed the information. Journalists, radio and TV presenters like to find stories of human interest with some connection to the local community.
If you can provide about 300 to 500 words about your group, the history of your organisation, individual performers, or the content of your concert along with good-quality photos suitable for a newspaper article, journalists and editors are more likely to publish a major feature in their editorial pages, which will be far more effective than any normal advertising. Photos for this purpose need to be in the original camera format, not compressed or reduced in any way. This also applies to photos used on posters. The Music Centre can easily produce copies of the photos suitable for websites, Facebook and email.
Given suitable material, the Music Centre can produce professional-standard posters, flyers and email templates at minimum cost. However, we do not have the resources to distribute posters around the city.
In all of the above imagery, human faces are the key to selling tickets. A poster design which is artistically magnificent might win an art award, but if it doesn’t contain an image of the performers, it won’t help in selling tickets.
A short text of 150 to 200 words describing the performers and the performance are required for our website, the TicketShop website and our bulk email. An even shorter text of less than 50 words is required for listing on the Civic Theatre’s calendars and flyers and the Community Information Centre’s Arts e-Bulletin.
Television and radio stations also provide free promotion of our events, but they need 2 to 3 weeks’ notice. ABC Local Radio and 4TTT may offer on-air interviews and sometimes live on-air performances.</p>
